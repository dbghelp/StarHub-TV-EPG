For years, only women competed, but now, for the first time, men were also allowed to take part at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, with a maximum of two per team. Frithjof Seidel is particularly pleased about this. The 27-year-old is currently the only man in the German national synchronized swimming team.</desc>
