		<title>Rick Stein's Cornwall (S2) - EP 7</title>
		<desc>Rick boards the ferry in Penzance to take him to the Isles of Scilly, a group of islands which were once part of Cornwall. And in the world-famous gardens of Tresco, Rick meets a beekeeper attempting to breed a native Scillonian honeybee to deal with the harsh Atlantic climate. This inspires Rick to cook a honey pudding with Cornish ice cream and a butterscotch sauce.</desc>
