		<title>PL STORIES - EP 32</title>
		<desc>In a nail-biting climax to the 2011-2012 Premier League season, Manchester City clinched the title with unparalleled drama. Facing Queens Park Rangers on the final matchday, City secured a 3-2 victory with Sergio Agüero's iconic last-minute goal, securing their first league title in 44 years and etching that game into footballing folklore. They have since become the dominant power in English football and we look at how it all began.</desc>
